# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction <br />
In this project, we will use different machine learning models to solve a regression problem of predicting house prices. We will accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:<br />
<br />
•	Understanding the problem statement<br />
•	Understanding the dataset<br />
•	Imputing Missing Values<br />
•	Checking correlations<br />
•	Removing highly correlated features<br />
•	Feature engineering<br />
•	Data Normalization<br />
•	Train and Test Split<br />
•	Train the model to fit the dataset<br />
•	Evaluate the model<br />
<br />
# Requirements<br />
These are the libraries we are going to use-<br />
•	numpy<br />
•	pandas<br />
•	matplotlib<br />
•	seaborn<br />
•	scikit-learn <br />
